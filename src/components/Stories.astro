    title={"THE PILLARS OF WOMEN EMPOWERMENT, "}
    subtitle={"Anuradha Nagne"}
    txt={" I understood the real meaning of the above phrase during my association with Sakhya. I was privileged to listen to many women leaders who have really made a difference to their society. These women shared with us their inspiring journey of how they managed to overcome a plethora of obstacles in their life to become a living example of women’s empowerment and the source of inspiration to other fellow women. This might be the age of feminism in the urban or western world. But in the internal parts of India, there is considerable division of women who are still deprived from primary education and empowerment. Women are capable of handling multiple roles effortlessly. They are actually the backbone of every society. But in these rural parts of India, what they really need is awareness, motivation, and optimistic support. The stories below of some of these women are real examples of such optimism and demonstrations of true leadership. Anuradha Sashikant Nagne is a struggling housewife who used to walk many miles to get her ration card, just to save on auto-rickshaw fare she couldn’t afford. This is where an idea clicked in her mind to empower herself by becoming an auto-rickshaw driver. She applied for a loan in a public bank through the help of a Social Worker and took a brave step forward in a male dominated field to become a lady auto rickshaw driver. She had to face a lot of difficulties. She was opposed by many male auto-rickshaw drivers and also had to go through many gender discrimination experiences. But her perseverance and do-not-give-up attitude paid-off. She now has not only empowered herself, but is also taking initiative in mentoring and convincing other under privileged women to stand on their feet and empower themselves  "}

    subtitle={"Bhadale Pada"}
    txt={"Savitri Santosh Vavre has been living in Bhadale Pada, Girij, for the past many  years. They run their lives by doing household chores, but life in Pada means many  problems to face. They have to go to a lake that is half a kilometer long to wash  their clothes. Also, the most important problem is the toilet. They were given a  toilet by the government, but their condition was very bad. The walls were only  made of bricks and had not been plastered. And wooden doors were installed.  Water was not provided. However, the villagers were using that toilet. A few  months ago, the doors of their toilets were broken, making it difficult for women to  use them. They had to use wooden planks while using toilets. And labor colonies  have been created right in front of where the toilet was built. Therefore, using the  toilet became very scary for women. So, the women of the pada would use the  toilet at night, and even if they went, they would take another women of the pada  along with them. And some women even used the toilet at the place where they  went to work. So, they felt that toilet repair was very necessary. The Sakhya  organization works in the Bhadale Pada community. A women's meeting is held  there every month. At that time, in a meeting, the women of the village asked the  organization for help in repairing the toilet. And the organization also extended a  helping hand to them. The director and community organizer of the organization  met Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation Commissioner, Shri. Anilkumar  Pawar sir, along with the women of the Bhadale Pada, and told them all about the situation. Commissioner Anilkumar Pawar promised to work at the earliest. And  within the next two days, the toilet started working as well. Old toilets were  repaired. They installed new doors, plastered the walls of the toilet, installed a  water tank for the toilet, and provided drainage. Now the women of Bhadale Pada  are using the toilet at any time without any fear. Earlier, they had to run to the  toilet. She has also thanked the Sakhya organization for the help, and she is now  using the toilet without fear."}

    subtitle={"Chandrakala Mishra"}
    txt={"Mrs.Chandrakala Mishra age 30 years living in Vijay Nagar near ganpati mandir. While taking session in that area regarding abuse against ladies. After completing this session Mrs. Chadrakala Mishra came to me and tried to tell me about the abuse that she’s been facing at home. She has been married for 15 years and has a school going daughter. Her husband lost his job before lockdown and is now working in Pune. Now her husband’s uncle (kak-sasra) is also staying with her in her house. To help out her husband she’s doing papad business at home. Later she explained how her husband’s uncle is keeping a watch on her and has been informing her husband about the money she has been earning from her papad business. Because of this her husband started transferring the money that was coming to her account from her business to his own account. So as she was earning money but still wasn’t able to spend on her own for her kids education and house rent and had to ask her husband for money everytime. So she went to her papad company and requested them to not deposit money on her husband’s account and to transfer it to her own account. After this when when her husband came to know about this he started physically abusing her by hitting her. Also when she goes to drop off the papads to her company, her husband’s uncle follows her and then later he tells her husband about how she goes out of the house and talks to other ladies on the way.Her husbands only wants her to stay at home make papad and take care to her children and her husband’s uncle. Her husband used to come home back from Pune once a week from his work and used to hit her by some or the other reasons. So I talked to Mrs. Mishra and asked her if she wanted me to have a talk with her husband or her husband’s uncle and if not i suggested her to go to police station and file a NC against them. Because her husband used to hit her in front of everyone and also shout if anyone tried to help her or interfere. Then i also told her if she is facing any major problems with her family members she can also go to Bharosa cell for help and submit a written letter there about her situation so that they can go talk to her husband.After listening to this whole situation they advised her that as all her money is coming to her bank account now she should use it wise fully and to ask her husband to pay for half of the children’s school fees. Also to ask him to help ik other household tasks. Later adviced her to save her own money and invest in some schemes provided by the post so that she can use her money in the future for herself. If she does all this she can become independent and not rely on anyone else for money or be beaten by anyone again. Also a common problem to such ladies is self doubt and be thinking if they can use their money or if they’ll lose their money, but if this us avoided and if they invest this money wisely they’ll have money to spend on themselves or their kids in future. So just like this i talk and explained everything to Mrs. Chandrakala Mishra and next time when we set up a camp she is going to invest in some of the useful schemes for future."}

    title={"FORGIVENESS MAKES TOGETHER FOREVER"}
    subtitle={" "}
    txt={" This testimony is from a married woman, aged 28 years. Her family includes her father-in-law, mother-in-law, two brothers-in-law and her husband. She had approached the Sakhya Women's Guidance Cell. She reported that she had been married for two years and that her husband was committing violence against her and treating her improperly. She was then four months pregnant and had been staying in her mother's house for four months. When she had called her husband to tell him about her pregnancy, he had responded by asking, 'What should I do?' He had not even been calling her on the phone for the past four months and was not coming to take her back despite her wishes. At home, she always had to ask her husband's permission even to receive phone calls, and was severely beaten by him four months ago, making her leave for her mother's house. The Sakhya Women's Guidance Cell counseled and motivated her to maintain her courage and speak freely, as well as acquainted her with the Domestic Violence act and the concept of Joint Meetings of spouses.  After imparting to her the understanding that their (she and her husband's) mutual expectations of each other will be clear to both spouses, her husband was contacted and invited to the Joint Meeting. He agreed to come and did so. On hearing each of them, the Sakhya Women's Guidance Cell educated the couple on laws that prohibit violence against women, and the repercussions of their dispute on the unborn child. After this, both of them consented to cohabitation. The statement saying 'both of us are willing to accept mutual expectations of each other and live together' was taken from each of them in writing. Her husband expected proper conduct from her with his parents and brothers while she expected him to cease all violence and exhibit proper conduct towards her. Both of them accepted these conditions and started living together again."}
